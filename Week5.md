# Week 5: Standards in curation
## I would use to describe them as I believe they are the most important:

- Metadata about the file itself:

- title (plus an optional subtitle if there is one): name of the transcribed piece
- composer: name of the individual(s)/band who created the musical work
- lyricist: name of the individual(s)/band who wrote the lyrics
- arranger: name of the person/band responsible for the particular arrangement of the piece of music
- encoder: name of the individual(s) that encoded the file
- source: source from which the file was transcribed
- size: physical size of the file itself
- publisher: name of the individual/organisation responsible for the publication of the piece of work
- publisherâ€™s location: postal address or at least a city of the publisher
- date: date of publication
- usage restrictions: legal statute of the work regarding its distribution, publication, etc.
