# Week 1: Basics of Music Data
## Task 1:
Theme Selection: **The Baroque Period**

**Reason:** The Baroque period, spanning from around 1600 to 1750, saw many influential composers like Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, and Antonio Vivaldi. Given its rich history and vast collection of works, it's feasible to obtain musical scores, metadata, and audio recordings associated with this period. For sources, I'd consider exploring the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), which is an extensive resource for public domain music scores.

## Task 2:
**Challenges to working with music and music-related data:**
- **Access:** Many vintage recordings or scores might be in private collections or under restrictive copyrights. This makes it difficult for researchers and enthusiasts to access them.
- **Curation:** With vast volumes of musical data available, effectively cataloging and organizing this data becomes a challenge. This becomes more difficult when considering various versions, editions, or interpretations of the same piece.
- **Distribution:** Especially for older recordings or scores, the condition may be deteriorating. Distributing them without loss of quality or authenticity is a challenge.
- **Interpretation and Analysis:** The same musical piece can have multiple interpretations. Analysing music data might need a consideration of these interpretations, which is complex.

**Relation to The Baroque Period theme:**
The Baroque period's music often faces challenges in access, particularly for less-renowned composers or pieces. While we have several well-preserved works from maestros like Bach or Handel, many compositions might have been lost over time or reside in private collections. 

In terms of curation, the Baroque period pieces can be found in various versions or editions, often based on interpretations or reconstructions. This poses challenges for a researcher or musician trying to stay authentic to a particular version.

For the current manifestations of data relating to the Baroque period, resources like IMSLP present musical scores, often collected from various sources, with details about the edition, publisher, and year. Descriptions might also include historical contexts, possible interpretations, and analyses. However, ensuring the accuracy of these descriptions and separating interpretations from authentic compositions can be a challenge.
