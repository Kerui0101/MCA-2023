# Week 2: Notation basics
 I have decided to transcribe: **Abscheuliche Tiefe des gro√üen Verderbens**


- **Original PDF file:** [Here](https://github.com/Kerui0101/MCA-2023/files/12810971/Week2.pdf)

- **Edited MuseScore file:** [Here](https://github.com/Kerui0101/MCA-2023/raw/master/data/Week%202.mscz)

- **Some changes needed:**
I need to add sheet music information (e.g. title, composer, lyrics, etc.).
The instrument is incorrect, I need to change the instrument to Flute, Violetta or Bassoon, Voice, Continuo,
Some of the note conversions are wrong and I need to correct them.
