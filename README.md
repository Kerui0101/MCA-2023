1. **Theme for Dataset: The Italian Madrigal in the Renaissance Period**

A significant form of secular vocal music called the Madrigal developed during the Renaissance period, especially in Italy. A large amount of documentation exists for this genre, including music scores dating back to the late 16th century, metadata about its history, evolution, and major composers, as well as audio recordings of both historical interpretations and modern renditions. The Italian Madrigal is an ideal theme for creating a comprehensive dataset.  Music manuscripts can be found in archives like RISM, which provide information about musical manuscripts.
