# Week 1
1. **Theme for Dataset: The Italian Madrigal in the Renaissance Period**

A significant form of secular vocal music called the Madrigal developed during the Renaissance period, especially in Italy. A large amount of documentation exists for this genre, including music scores dating back to the late 16th century, metadata about its history, evolution, and major composers, as well as audio recordings of both historical interpretations and modern renditions. The Italian Madrigal is an ideal theme for creating a comprehensive dataset.  Music manuscripts can be found in archives like RISM, which provide information about musical manuscripts.

2. **Challenges and their manifestations in the selected theme:**

- **Access:** Many historical manuscripts might be held in private collections, or in libraries with limited access. For the Italian Madrigal, some original scores might be in fragile conditions or in places that haven't digitized their collections.

- **Curation:** Gathering data, especially for older genres like the Italian Madrigal, requires understanding the historical context, including the evolution of notation, language, and performance practice. Julia Cumming and Cory McCay's article on "Revisiting the Origins of the Italian Madrigal (with machine learning)" provides insights into how technology can aid in understanding these historical contexts.

- **Distribution:** Ensuring the correct metadata and maintaining the integrity of music data is a major challenge. Tony Brooke's article "Descriptive Metadata in the Music Industry: Why it is Broken and How to Fix it" sheds light on the issues surrounding metadata, which would be particularly pertinent when addressing older genres where historical context and accurate description are crucial.

- **Copyright:** Especially for modern renditions and scholarly works on older music, copyright can be a hindrance. "Music and Copyright" by Marshall and Frith discusses the implications of copyright in music, which can be significant when collating a comprehensive dataset.

- **Technology & Encoding:** With older musical genres, converting handwritten scores into a digital format is challenging. MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) discussed by Krabbe and Geertinger, and MuRET, a tool discussed by Rizo et al., are attempts to address this challenge.

- **Analysis:** The Italian Madrigal, being polyphonic, presents challenges in terms of analysis. Thomae, Cumming, and Fujinaga's paper on "Counterpoint error-detection tools for optical music recognition of Renaissance polyphonic music" delves into the complexities of analyzing such intricate music.

All of these challenges are presented by the Italian Madrigal due to its age, polyphonic nature, and significance in history of music. A variety of methods are being used to curate data related to it, including traditional methods such as studying manuscripts and modern methods such as machine learning. Various formats are used to present this data, including scholarly articles, digitized scores, and audio recordings, as well as complex databases and digital libraries.  In musicology and digital humanities, data is presented, described, and analyzed continuously due to their interdisciplinary nature.
